OmniDictionary(wip)
==============

This is a chrome extension to consult a dictionary for words from Omnibox. Thanks for Dejizo api.

If you want to know a meaning of a word, you type "dic" and one space in your chrome omnibox, and continuously type a word.
Then the meaning of it will be shown under the omnibox.

This extension is work in progress now.
